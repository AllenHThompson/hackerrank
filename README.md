### Two Characters - Easy
String 't' always consists of two distinct alternating characters. For example, if string 's' two distinct characters are x and y, then 't' could be 'xyxyx' or 'yxyxy' but not 'xxyy' or 'xyyx'.

You can convert some string 's' to string 't' by deleting characters from 's'. When you delete a character from 's', you must delete all occurrences of it in 's'. For example, if 's' = 'abaacdabd' and you delete the character a, then the string becomes 'bcdbd'.

Given 's', convert it to the longest possible string 't'. Then print the length of string 't' on a new line; if no string 't' can be formed from 's', print 0 instead.

Input Format
The first line contains a single integer denoting the length of .
The second line contains string .

Output Format
Print a single integer denoting the maximum length of 't' for the given 's'; if it is not possible to form string 't', print 0 instead.

Constraints
*1 <= 's' <= 1000
*'s' only contains lowercase English alphabetic letters (i.e., a to z).

### Mini-Max Sum - Easy
Given five positive integers, find the minimum and maximum values that can be calculated by summing exactly four of the five integers. Then print the respective minimum and maximum values as a single line of two space-separated long integers.

Input Format
A single line of five space-separated integers.

Constraints
Each integer is in the inclusive range [1, 10^9].

Output Format
Print two space-separated long integers denoting the respective minimum and maximum values that can be calculated by summing exactly four of the five integers. (The output can be greater than 32 bit integer.)

Sample Input
1 2 3 4 5

Sample Output
10 14
